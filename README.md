# Dealer's Choice - Bartending App

## Description

"Dealer's Choice" is a bartending app that helps users make cocktails based on the ingredients they have at home. Users can input their available ingredients, which are then compared to a list of classic cocktails. If there's a match, the app displays those drinks under the title "Drinks that you can make!" Users can also click on classic cocktail links to access recipe websites and enjoy jazz music through the audio button.
